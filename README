## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This was my first time ever using a mac so it took a while to get used to the different layout.
It was also my first time doing extensive coding, but it was a lot of fun once I got the hang of it.
Challenges I encountered were...
  Getting the simulator to have the right scale. Right now it's a bit too small but before items would show up huge
  Understanding where in the view controller life-cycle to put different commands
  Typos in my code which I had trouble identifying
